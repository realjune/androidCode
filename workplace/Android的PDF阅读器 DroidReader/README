PREREQUISITES

In order to build DroidReader, you need:

- the sources of DroidReader, but you managed that already...

- source code of the MuPDF software/library

- source code of libjpeg

- source code of freetype2

- source code of jbig2dec

- source code of openjpeg

- the Android Native Development Kit (NDK)

- and of course the Android SDK.

Optionally, you might want to use Eclipse and the Android plugin
for development. The sources are structured to easily have them
imported as a new project.

When you have done this, do the following:

- copy or symlink the libjpeg sources to the

  jni/jpeg/

  folder.
  Within that folder, make a copy of "jconfig.txt" with the
  name "jconfig.h". The NDK-based build run will otherwise
  complain on the missing "jconfig.h".

- copy or symlink the freetype2 sources into the

  jni/freetype/

  folder.

- copy or symlink the jbig2dec sources into the

  jni/jbig2dec/

  folder.

- copy or symlink the openjpeg sources into the

  jni/openjpeg/

  folder.

- copy or symlink the MuPDF sources into the

  jni/mupdf/

  folder.

- make a symlink to the project root directory (containing
  this file) into the Android NDK's

  app/

  folder.

Your project tree is now ready.


COMPILING

The first step is to compile the native JNI library. In order to
do that, change your current working dir to the JNI root directory
and start the make run:

  $ make APP=droidreader

(this is for the case you named the symlink "droidreader")

Until now, the author only used the Eclipse IDE with the Android
plugin to build the application. So just open the project and have
Eclipse build it.


DOWNLOAD

The latest sources of this application should always be available
at the following web site:

INSTALLING

You can use the Android SDK's "adb install" command to install
the readily built .apk package.
